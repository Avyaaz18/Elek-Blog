# Microchip Unveils Groundbreaking DC-DC Converter for Space Applications


In the ever-evolving world of satellite technology, Microchip has just unveiled something groundbreaking—the [LE50-28](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/IPS/ProductDocuments/DataSheets/LE50-28-Single-Series-Datasheet-DS00005350.pdf) series of radiation-tolerant DC-DC converters. These are specifically crafted for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, meeting the growing demands of 5G communication, cube satellites, and IoT applications.

### Why This Matters 

The demand for dependable, reasonably priced, and adaptable space-grade technologies is higher than ever because of the expanding LEO market. In between the more costly radiation-hardened alternatives and non-radiation-tolerant commercial converters, these isolated DC-DC converters provide an affordable alternative. Because of this, they are both reasonably priced and compatible with missions.

### What Makes the [LE50-28 Series](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/about/news-releases/products/radiation-tolerant-dc-dc-50-watt-power-converters) Stand Out?

1. **Versatility**: Available in nine variants, the LE50-28 series provides both single and triple output options, ranging from 3.3V to 28V.
2. **Compact and Lightweight**: The converter weighs just 120 grams, and the EMI filter weighs 82 grams. This makes them easy to integrate into various devices while meeting MIL-STD-461 standards for quick qualification.
3. **Radiation Tolerance**: With a total ionizing dose of up to 50 Krad and latch-up immunity of 37 MeV×cm²/mg, these converters are built to withstand the harsh conditions of LEO applications.
4. **Efficiency**: The LE50-28 series boasts an impressive 80% power conversion efficiency at full load. This reduces the payload size and weight by minimizing energy storage needs.
5. **High Performance**: Supporting up to 50W per unit and up to 200W by paralleling four units, the triple-output version offers three unique outputs in the same footprint, making it incredibly versatile.

### Conclusion

Operating from a 28V bus and featuring an integrated EMI filter to reduce interference, the LE50-28 series is a reliable and efficient solution for satellite applications. With a mean time between failures of one million hours, these converters promise long-term reliability, making them an excellent choice for the next generation of space technology.
